### What I learned

I started this challenge right after learning React features. This challenge definitely helped me understand React better. I learned how to use React Router, CSS Modules. Now i understand better how and when to use different React hooks, how to pass data through components via props and I'm definitely better at writing CSS now than i was before i started this challenge.
